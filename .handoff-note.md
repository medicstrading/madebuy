# Handoff from System Manager

## What Was Fixed

**Issue:** Admin `/dashboard/media` page crashed with "Something went wrong" and `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'B' before initialization`

**Root Cause:** In `BulkUploadModal.tsx`, a `useEffect` referenced `handleUploadAll` in its dependency array before the function was defined.

## Commits Already Pushed to main

1. **e746e85** - `sitemap.ts` fix for Docker build
2. **3ef329a** - `BulkUploadModal.tsx` fix for ReferenceError

## TODO

1. **Verify Railway deployment completed** - check if new code is live
2. **Test production media page** - https://madebuyadmin-production.up.railway.app/dashboard/media
3. **Test Bulk Upload modal** - the component that had the bug

## Files Changed

- `apps/web/src/app/sitemap.ts` - handles missing MONGODB_URI during build
- `apps/admin/src/components/media/BulkUploadModal.tsx` - fixed useCallback ordering
