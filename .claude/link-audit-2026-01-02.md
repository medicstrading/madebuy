# MadeBuy Link Audit Report
**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Status:** All issues resolved

## Summary

Found and fixed **9 broken routes** in the web app that were causing 500 errors. These routes were linked in the footer and navigation but had no corresponding pages, causing requests to fall through to the `[tenant]` dynamic route which threw "Shop not found" errors.

---

## Routes Fixed

| Route | Status | Action Taken |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| `/pricing` | ✅ Fixed | Created pricing page with plan comparison |
| `/marketplace/sellers` | ✅ Fixed | Created sellers listing using `marketplace.getTopSellers()` |
| `/marketplace/new` | ✅ Fixed | Created new arrivals using `marketplace.listMarketplaceProducts()` |
| `/marketplace/about` | ✅ Fixed | Created about page with company info |
| `/seller-stories` | ✅ Fixed | Created placeholder for seller testimonials |
| `/help` | ✅ Fixed | Created FAQ/help center page |
| `/contact` | ✅ Fixed | Created contact form page |
| `/terms` | ✅ Fixed | Created terms of service page |
| `/privacy` | ✅ Fixed | Created privacy policy page |

## Root Cause

The web app uses a `[tenant]` dynamic route at the root level. Any unmatched route falls through to this dynamic route, which attempts to resolve a tenant by slug. When no tenant matches (e.g., "pricing", "help"), it throws an error.

**Solution:** Create explicit routes for all linked pages so they match before falling through to `[tenant]`.

---

## Links Verified Working

After fixes, all routes return HTTP 200:
- ✅ /pricing
- ✅ /marketplace/sellers
- ✅ /marketplace/new  
- ✅ /marketplace/about
- ✅ /seller-stories
- ✅ /help
- ✅ /contact
- ✅ /terms
- ✅ /privacy

---

## Admin App Links

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `/dashboard/connections/social` | ✅ Working | Page exists |
| `/dashboard/materials/report` | ⚠️ Redirects | Redirects to login (expected behavior) |
| `/pricing` (linked from admin) | ⚠️ Cross-app | Links to web app /pricing (now works) |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Footer Template:** Consider creating a shared footer component to ensure consistent links across marketplace pages

2. **Link Validation:** Add a pre-commit hook or CI check to validate internal links exist

3. **404 Handling:** The `[tenant]` catch-all could gracefully show a 404 instead of throwing when no tenant found
